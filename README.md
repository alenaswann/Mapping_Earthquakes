# Mapping Earthquakes
### This assignment is to assist in mapping earthquakes from the last seven days. The javascript and css files build a webpage that displays three distict world map options with three optional overlays to display tectonic plate locations, all earthquakes, major earthquakes (4.5+ magnitude) within the last week. The earthquakes points are distinguished by circle markers and correlate with magnitude by both color and radius size.
