# Mapping Earthquakes
### This assignment is to assist in mapping earthquakes from the last seven days. The javascript and css files build a webpage that displays three distict world map options with three optional overlays to display all earthquakes, major earthquakes (4.5+ magnitude), and the tectonic plate locations. The earthquakes points are distinguished by circle markers and correlate with magnitude by both color and radius size.
